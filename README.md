### What is this?
A skateboard app from a boarder to all skateboarders which intends to help out the community

### Am I seeing this before time?
At this very time, yes. I am currently working/studying/trying to make this thing happen.

### How is this thing going to run?
My expectations are to get the project running with my own support in the very beginning and eventually get a crowdfunded source from all people around skateboarding community who support this concept.

### A brief note
All the code for the smartphone app is out here, in an open source manner, in a way to keep both the spirit of the thing free, and even maybe to help out for contributions in the future
